# GrooveFusion-JazzHouseHop - 
Please find 2 parts of the project - Tunepad (audio) and processing (visual). Due to compatibility errors, processing could not import MP3/ WAV.
(just in case you can't find link for TunePad: https://tunepad.com/project/84162)

# Introduction - 
GrooveFusion is a project that blends music and visual art into one engaging experience! Using TunePad, I crafted an original song, and while processing, I created a video, bringing the song to life. My goal was to provide a fresh escape from boring and repetitive music. A song and music video emerged through algorithmic coding techniques, making GrooveFusion the next top hit!!  

# Technologies -
The platforms used were TunePad and Processing
The type of programming language used was Python

# Acknowledgements - 
The code conducted is credited to my teacher, who showed me the basics and Linked In, Madecraft Full-Service Learning Content Company, who independently showed me the basics. The Tune pad and processing resources available on their websites helped me understand the code's language.
